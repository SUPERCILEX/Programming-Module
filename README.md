# Software Module

### Getting Started

You should probably start by downloading the exercises project that accompanies this guide. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/software-module-exercizes), along with instructions for how to use it.

This guide is organized sequentially by parts, and each part has several focused lessons that each cover a specific concept. Ready to get started? Dive into the [introduction](https://sert.gitbook.io/software-module/~/edit/drafts/-LLJ_143YLVaFXak2ftl/introduction-1/hello-world)!

### Getting Help

If you are on SERT, of course you can always talk to a member of the programming for help. Also, if you find a lesson unclear, feel free to submit an issue explaining what is unclear.
