# Software Module

## Getting Started

To get started with this tutorial, first clone or download the GitHub repository software-module-exercises. If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, this is very simple.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/software-module-exercises.git
```

Alternatively, just press the **Clone or download** button and then **Download ZIP**, and then extract the project files.

After you have the project downloaded, you need to open it with some type of editor or _IDE \(Integrated development enviorment\)_. Although you can use any IDE, the project was created with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) in mind. After you set up your IDE, you should be able to edit and run the exercises on in the project.
