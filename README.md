# SERT Software Module

Welcome to the SERT Software Module! After completing this guide, you'll have the skills necessary
to contribute to SERT's robot code.

We write our robots in Kotlin, a language created by JetBrains, the very same people to bring you
IntelliJ! Kotlin is a simple and clean language based off of Java, and makes programming fun, easy
and incredibly efficient. Like any programming language, it can take a while to become proficient,
especially if this is your first time every programming. If you follow along with these modules,
though, you'll become a robot coding master in no time.

What's more, learning to program in robotics is just the first step. Programming teaches you how
to think and solve complex problems, and can be applied to many other tasks even outside of STEM
fields. Programming on SERT is a lot of fun, but will benefit you in many other aspects of your
life as well.
