# Software Module

### Getting Started

You should probably start by downloading the exercises project that accompanies this guide. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/software-module-exercises), along with instructions for how to use it.

This guide is organized sequentially by parts, and each part has several focused lessons that each cover a specific concept. Ready to get started? Dive into the [introduction](https://learn.sert2521.org/software-module/introduction/hello-world)!

### Getting Help

If you are on SERT, of course you can always talk to a member of the programming subteam for help. Also, if you find a lesson unclear, feel free to submit a GitHub issue explaining what is unclear, or a Pull Request to fix or add anything you feel would be beneficial for future students!
